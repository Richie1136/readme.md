Hello im Richard Hagenah, I began my journey to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer about a year and a half ago when I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I knew I liked computer and took a web development class back in high school, then I found Kenzie Academy which was a 12 month Full Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp
